*Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects*

The Challenge: 

The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a flagship rural development program in India, initiated to provide all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations. Over the years, the program has evolved through different phases or schemes (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA, etc.), each with potentially distinct objectives, funding mechanisms, and project specifications. 

For government bodies, infrastructure planners, and policy analysts, efficiently categorizing thousands of ongoing and completed projects is crucial for effective monitoring, transparent budget allocation, and assessing the long-term impact of these schemes. Manual classification is time-consuming, prone to errors, and scales poorly. 

Your specific task is to design, build, and evaluate a machine learning model that can automatically classify a road or bridge construction project into its correct PMGSY_SCHEME based on its physical and financial characteristics.
